# ABB-robot-welding-simulation
This simulation features two ABB IRB 1410 robots (IRB1410_01 and IRB1410_02) programmed to perform automated welding on a test workpiece mounted to a positioner turntable (IRBP_L). The turntable acts as an external axis, enabling synchronized motion with the robots for precise and efficient welding operations.
