# ABB-robot-welding-simulation
This simulation features two ABB IRB 1410 robots (IRB1410_01 and IRB1410_02) programmed to perform automated welding on a test workpiece mounted to a positioner turntable (IRBP_L). The turntable acts as an external axis, enabling synchronized motion with the robots for precise and efficient welding operations.
A Binzel air-cooled welding torch is used as the tool for both robots. The simulation replicates a coordinated dual-robot welding cell, showcasing the integration of external axes and tool center point (TCP) control within an ABB robotic system.

The project was developed in ABB RobotStudio, using RobotWare version 6.08.01, and includes complete robot paths, tool configuration, work object setup, and external axis calibration.

It has been packaged as a Pack and Go solution for easy sharing and deployment. The simulation can be run directly in RobotStudio, and all associated RAPID code is accessible for review and modification.
